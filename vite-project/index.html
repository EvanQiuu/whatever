        beloved by children. It consists of two slices of bread, a bit of tomato
        sauce, and fritz. Fritz is a type of cheap sausage meat that's believed

        dog on a stick that is dipped in batter, then deep-fried in hot oil.

        Though often called the koala “bear,” this cuddly animal is not a bear
        at all; it is a marsupial, or pouched mammal. After giving birth, a
        female koala carries her baby in her pouch for about six months. When
        the infant emerges, it rides on its mother's back or clings to her
        belly, accompanying her everywhere until it is about a year old.

        The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods,
        meaning "large foot"). In common use the term is used to describe the
        largest species from this family, the red kangaroo, as well as the
        antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo.
        Kangaroos are indigenous to Australia and New Guinea.

        Cassowaries feed mainly on fruit, although all species are truly
        omnivorous and take a range of other plant foods, including shoots and
        grass seeds, in addition to fungi, invertebrates, and small vertebrates.
        Cassowaries are very wary of humans, but if provoked, they are capable
        of inflicting serious, even fatal, injuries to both dogs and people. The
        cassowary has often been labeled "the world's most dangerous bird"
